Doxygen:
Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.
Doxygen can output documentation in a variety of useful formats, including: HTML, RTF, Latex and Man Pages.

You can use Doxygen to generate:
1.on-line documentation browser (in HTML) 
2.off-line reference manual (in $\mbox{\LaTeX}$) from a set of documented source files
3.output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages
The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code
You can configure doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files(handy for large source code)
You can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "gsequence"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1.0

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = /home/lnh/work/projects/gutils/sequence

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 
# 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output 
# format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. 
# Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of 
# source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would 
# otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = YES

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this 
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language. 
# The default language is English, other supported languages are: 
# Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, 
# Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, 
# Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages), Korean, Korean-en, Norwegian, 
# Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, 
# Swedish, and Ukrainian.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# This tag can be used to specify the encoding used in the generated output. 
# The encoding is not always determined by the language that is chosen, 
# but also whether or not the output is meant for Windows or non-Windows users. 
# In case there is a difference, setting the USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING tag to YES 
# forces the Windows encoding (this is the default for the Windows binary), 
# whereas setting the tag to NO uses a Unix-style encoding (the default for 
# all platforms other than Windows).

USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING   = NO

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend 
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. 
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the 
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator 
# that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string 
# in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be 
# stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is 
# used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. 
# If left blank, the following values are used ("$name" is automatically 
# replaced with the name of the entity): "The $name class" "The $name widget" 
# "The $name file" "is" "provides" "specifies" "contains" 
# "represents" "a" "an" "the"

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       = 

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then 
# Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief 
# description.
 
Concepts
Configuration
For each project you make that uses Doxygen, you must create a configuration file. The configuration file contains all information about how and what Doxygen will comment. A well documented Doxygen config file can be found at http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/tutorials/doxygen/

Some of the more important settings are:

PROJECT_NAME = ``Your Project''
the name of your project

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = ``/home/username/public_html/doc/''
the directory doxygen will output it's documentation

INPUT = ``src/''
tells doxygen where to look for your source code

RECURSIVE = YES
tells doxygen to go into subdirectories to find source code

Doxygen must also be told what to output to.  For example, if you
wanted HTML output:

GENERATE_HTML = YES
tells Doxygen to output to html

HTML_OUTPUT = html/
tells Doxygen where to put html documentation, relative to
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

HTML_FILE_EXTENSION = .html
tells what the extension of the html files should be (.htm or .html)

a header and footer for each page can also be set with the HTML_HEADER
and HTML_FOOTER options

There are similar options for RTF, Latex and Man Pages.

Documenting Your Code

Doxygen derives documentation from comments of two basic forms.
/**  */ and ///.  Doxygen documents whatever immediately follows the
doxygen comment.

/**
 * Class documentation appears here
 */
class SomeClass
{
  /// varaible Documentation
  int var;

  /** Documenting Method1 */
  void Method1();

  /// Documenting Method2
  void Method2();
};


In some cases it may be desirable to put documentation after an item,
in which case you can use the commenting form /**< */ and ///<.

/**
 * Class documentation appears here
 */
class SomeClass
{
  int var;         ///< variable documentation after
  void Method1();  /**< Documenting Method1 after */
  void Method2();  ///< Documenting Method2 after
};

There are a variety of commands that can be used within these special
comment blocks.  Doxygen commands are preceeded by either a \ or an @
(either is fine).  Some of the more common ones are:

param
return
author
date
file

Special commands for method documentation can be used as follows:

/**
 * Takes an integer and squares it
 * \param a The integer to be squared
 * \return The integer squared
 */
int square(int a);



Commands used for documentation of a file:

/**
 * \file someFile.h
 * \author Some Guy
 * \date 2-26-04
 */


There are a variety of other useful commands and formatting options,
check out the Doxygen website for more information.

Running Doxygen

To run doxygen just use the command doxygen followed by your
configuration file

doxygen project.cfg

Doxygen will generate documentation and output to the directory
specified in the config file.
