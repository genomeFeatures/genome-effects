1. When building base classes
   a. Do not implement a class contructor in the base class if you want the derived classes to have their own implemented constructors
   b. derived classes do not implement parametrized constructors when the base class has an implemented parametrized constructor
      They call the base class constructor as follow:
      genomeFeature::genomeFeature(string toolBaseDir):ggenome(toolBaseDir){}
      where ggenome is the constructor of the base class.
     Otherwise you get an error "undefined reference to 'condtructor of base class'"
2. A derived class can not instantiate an object of another derived class of the same base class.
   For example: I have two derived classes features and files from the same base class ggenome
   In features, I have a member function parseFile that parses lines of a file.But files class already
   knows how to do this so I created files fileObject and tried to access these functionalites but 
  got  undefined reference to `ggenome::ggenome()'. It only works when I pass fileObject as an argument 
  to class features's function

3. One disadvantage of implementing a contructor in the base class
   is that you to explicitly implement constructor(s) in the derived class

4. Rule of thumb:  functions
   a. pass single-value variable by value, 
   b. container-type variable by reference
   c. use void for container-types and pass the result storage by reference
   
5. Finding the shortest path in the graph between nodes n1 and n2
  a. find all the children of n1
  b. (n2 is the child of n1)?done:get the parent of n2
  c. (n2 has no parent)?done:compare n2 parents with n1 children
  d. (
  
/*curl is a client to get documents/files from or send documents to a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The command is designed to work without user interaction or any kind of interactivity.
curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, ftp upload, HTTP post, SSL (https:) connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more.
URL
The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC 2396. 
-s/--silent
    Silent mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages. Makes Curl mute.

    If this option is used twice, the second will again disable mute.
