Tools optimization:

Run genome sequence data extraction tools by chromosome
1. rearrange input query by chromosome
2. genome indexing
   a. get the chromosme fasta file and convert it to oneliner
   b. index it into a memory structure char* chrom= content of the fasta chromosome file
3. index gene annotations
  a. index annotations by genomic region [chr,strand,start]
  b. index annotations by transcript name
  c. index annotations by gene name
