Project:
Generate SNPs counts within the founder strains(B6, A/J, NOD, NZO, 129S1,WSB,PWK,and CAST) 
in each of these regions, counted in two different ways:  
(a) total number of SNPs within any founder strain, and 
Question: Is this the total number of SNP within the specified genomic region?
Note: B6 will always have SNPs as it is the reference strain in the database

(b) count of the SNPs in the strain of interest is different than all of the other 7 founder strains.
Question: does this mean that within the specified genomic region for a given strain, only
 count cases where this strain is the only one across all 8 cc founder strains with the SNP allele.
 For example: for SNP[i].alleles=A/G  this strain has "G" and the rest of the 7 cc founders have "A"

Input:
 1. Genomic loci from Narayanan  
 2. CGDSNPDB --> Imputed - Jeremy R. Wang et al. 2012 ?
    or Ensembl SNPs?

Output:
Same intervals with the two SNP counts that I just defined.

Question:
Is it right to assume that the first count (a),is global and the second count(b) is strain specific.
For example the output will have the following fields in addition to the original interval:
1.SNP_count -> total SNP count from (a)
2.B6        --> total SNP count within region where B6 is the only one with the SNP allele
3.A/J       --> total SNP count within region where A/J is the only one with the SNP allele
4.NOD       --> total SNP count within region where NOD is the only one with the SNP allele
5.NZO       --> total SNP count within region where NZO is the only one with the SNP allele
6.129S1     --> total SNP count within region where 129S1 is the only one with the SNP allele
7.WSB       --> total SNP count within region where WSB is the only one with the SNP allele
8.PWK       --> total SNP count within region where PWK is the only one with the SNP allele
9.CAST      --> total SNP count within region where CAST is the only one with the SNP allele
