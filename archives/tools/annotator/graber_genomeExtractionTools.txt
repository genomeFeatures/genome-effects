*****************************************************
The database
*****************************************************
a. Different datasets
  1. mgi --> anotations   (done)
  2. ucsc --> annotations (transcriptome, ESTs alignments)
  3. ensembl -->{annotations, repeats} (done)
  4. uniprot -->{protein domains,} (done) -- Should I keep using uniprot or should I switch to using ensembl protein annotations?
  5. ebi --> miRNA (done) -- retiring (replacing it with mirbase)
  6. CC founder strains --> annotations (done)
  7. rnaSeq --> annotations {Nazira generates these annotations} --> in progress
  8. novel --> annotations {could be from some local research labs) --> maybe 

b. Database loads
   The database load script expect the annotation file to be in gene Prediction format, 
   the annotation source and organism version known. Also the coordinates base, 0-base or 1-base, 
   of features start and end known.The following steps
   are taken in order to load a new dataset into the database.
   1. run fileConverter if needed --gtf2genePred, or --gff2genePred, or --gff32genePred  (in progress)
      currently done as a perl script specific to every dataset (ensembl, mgi)
      but will convert this into one standard program
   2. run load_annotations.pl  -> (done)
  
c. Load scheduling
 1.mgi - a cron job that runs monthly is already in place . It runs on the 7th, mgi generates new updates on the 3-4th
 2.ucsc - monthly? need this to set a cron job - from their site : not really specified - some updates are daily, some weekly
 3.ensembl - monthly or every two months? or check manually ensembl site for the next
            scheduled release? (maybe on the 9th?)

 4.uniprot - monthy? (uniprot updates its UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot -fully annotated curated entries - every four weeks)
             so maybe a cron job that runs on the 15th?
             I would rather load protein domains from ensembl for consistency (data by organism version). Also protein domains from uniprot
             are organism specific.I need the organism version of the data.

 5.miRNA - Note: I'm Changing data source from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ to http://www.mirbase.org/ftp.shtml 
            the reason being mirbase has updates,more organisms (32 vs 20), and there are organism versions (a plus).
           so maybe run updates as available?

 6.CC founder strains -- as available
 7.rnaSeq - as available
 
d. Database maintenance
  1. How many versions (K) of a given organism should we keep 
     a. annotations in the database
     b. genome sequence on our server
  2. Write a cleanup script (cron job?) that runs after the last database update
     to collect all organisms with K versions
  3. What actions should we take if more than K found:
     i. generate archives (annotations and genome)?
     ii.reconstruct database indices, and update config files?

e. Database access
  1. web services - one exists already -need to have more? or one with multiple functionalities?
  2. perl apis    - some perl scripts exist,....
  3. mysql public server?
  4. cpp libraries 
  5. ...

Graber Tools & Libraries
******************************************************
Note:
 a. running any of the tools with -s option displays the list 
    of all organisms and the organism versions we currently have in the database
     example ./program -s

 b. running any of the tools with -l option displays the list 
     of current gene predictions for the specified organism version
   example ./program -v mm9 -l  (will list all the annotation sources we have for mm9)

 c. running any of the tools with --genomes option should display the list
    of organism versions we have the genome (chromosome ) data -- > in progress

######################################################
a. snpAnnotator (cpp),snpValidator(cpp) --> uses ggenome c++ libraries
######################################################
Who're the target users of snpAnnotator? or How will snpAnnotator be used?
   1. On the web -- small/medium datasets, single SNP
      a. By other researchers
      b. By students
      c. Software developers
   2. Standalone -- large/very large datasets, single SNP
      a. By other researchers
      b. Software developers  
      c. pipelines

   Each SNP source comes with information describing each SNP assay. 
   The SNP file is tab-delimited and contains each SNP's [label (e.g. dbSNP rs#)], chromosome, position, strand, and alleles. 
   recognized input types:
   1. Infinium SNP support file
      example: SNP        CHROMOSOME   POSITION     STRAND   ALLELES
               rs123456        6       26020613        +       A/T
   2. Affymetrix SNP support file
      example: SNP      CHROMOSOME POSITION STRAND  ALLELE
              rs123456      7     78244234    +       G 
   3. A signal file.
      example: AFFYID         RSID   pos   AlleleA AlleleB
              SNP_A-0123456  rs001  10000 C       T
  Note:
   a. Another recognized chromosome field label is: chr
   b. Other recognized position field labels are (case incensitive): bpPos,bpPosition,location
   c. Other recognized ALLELE field labels are (case incensitive): ref_allele,reference_allele,refAllele,referenceAllele,
        ref_base,reference_base,refBase,referenceBase,
   c. Other recognized ALLELEB field labels are (case incensitive): consensus_base,snp_Allele,
                                    other_Allele,consensusBase,snpAllele,otherAllele,

 Note: This program is being modified to accept gene annotation files (gtf, genePred formats) 
      and gene annotation sources in addition to SNP input file. If the gene annotation file is not provided, then the program will
      check if an annotation source was specified or defaults to  gene annotation sources (all?) from grabber transcript database 
      for the selected organism version. grabber transcript annotation file is generated using 
      the script getCoordinates.pl (this will be a function call).The default organism is mouse current version.
      If the result file is not specified, the output will be standard out.
      The program validates all single position SNPs (novel and existing) from an input against the specified  
      reference genome assembly build.The program also checks for reference allele  and snp allele consistency and sets the 
      flags accordingly.Also tags CpG Sites, and Mutation types (transition or transversion).

The result includes:
  1.) oginal fields list
  2. QA report fields
     a. QA_tag
        0-> normal, no action taken; 
        2-> ref_allele call matches reverse strand - then Alleles are complemented
        3-> Bad ref_allele call, does not match allele on ref genome (both + and -) and does not match snp_allele; 
        4-> ref_allele matches (N) on reference genome
        5-> ref_allele matches the other_allele (allele swap)
     b. CpG_flag
     c. mutation type (present only if snp_allele was provided)
     d. Fields count missmatch between header and data
  3.) In addition to fields in 1.) an 2.), the result of the simple version will have the following fields appended to it:
           Exon,ExonID(s),Intron,Intergenic,TranscriptID(s),GeneSymbol,geneStrand,annotationSorceDbSchema
      Where:
         Exon: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on exon
         ExonID(s): a commas separated list of all the exons containing the SNP
         Intron: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on intron
         Intergenic: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on intergenic region
         Function_class: a commas separated list of all the functional implications of this SNP on this gene
         TranscriptID(s): a commas separated list of all the transcripts containing the SNP
         GeneSymbol: gene symbol 
 
  4.) In addition to fields in 1.) an 2.),the result of the SNP coding version will have the following fields appended to it:
           Exon,ExonID(s),Intron,Intergenic,codingClass,TranscriptID(s),GeneSymbol,geneStrand,ensemblDbSchema
      Where:
         Exon: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on exon
         ExonID(s): a commas separated list of all the exons of this gene containing the SNP
                where each exon has additional information including: snpFrame,CDS_len,snpPosInCDS,codonPosInProtein    
         Intron: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on intron
         Intergenic: Yes/No -- Yes if SNP is locate on intergenic region
         Function_class: a commas separated list of all the functional implications of this SNP on this gene
         TranscriptID(s): a commas separated list of all the transcripts of this gene containing the SNP
         GeneSymbol: gene symbol 

  5. Should we include additional info for the genomic region the SNP is found? 
     for example:
     a. Add a "repeat" column in the results that is set to [yes or no]
     b. Add a "miRNA" column in the results that is set to [yes,no, NA]
     b. Add a "qtl" column in the results that is set to [yes,no]

getCordinates (perl)
######################################################
Genome cordinates extraction tool.This tool extracts the genome coordinates of all
the transcripts/features within the query term of the specified organism version and annotation source
 or all the feature coordinates of a given organism version if no query term specified.
The features are stored into the database using the zero-based cordinates standard for feature starts
  and 1-based cordinate standard for feature ends.The result coordinates are in 1-base for both starts and ends.
The result file of this program can be used by other programs, for example snpAnnotator, getTxFastaSeq,...
The script generates a gene prediction file or a gtf file depending on the features type and the -F flag.
1. current feature types
   a. tx -> transcripts (genePred or gtf formats)
   b. ex -> exons (gtf format)
   c. lex -> last exon (3'exon) (gtf format)
   d. fex -> first exon (5'exon) (gtf format)
   e. tex -> terminal exons (3' and 5' exons) (gtf format)

2. current recognized search terms:
   a. gene name
   b. gene accession id
   c. transcript accession id
   d. genomic region, format - chr:chrStart-chrEnd
Note: we could add features like
  a.intExJuction [with flanking=K] (gtf format)
  b.exIntJunction [with flanking=K] (gtf format)
  c.repeat  --> from ensembl (gtf format)
  e.introns (gtf format)
  d.qtl  --> from ensembl (gtf format)
  f.est  --> from ucsc (gtf format)
  g.mirna --> mirbase (gtf format)

Note: 
1. If the option -T is not specified, the program will generate all the feature coordinates
  for the specified organism version and feature type

2. if the -a option is not specified, features from all the annotation sources are generated
   the features are displayed by annotation source

      
#################################################
getTxFastaSeq, getSeq (cpp), --> uses ggenome c++ libraries
#################################################
Note:coordinates in the input annotations file are in 1-base cordinates standard.
Take a gtf,a bed, or a genePred file with feature coordinates and generates the associated fasta sequence.
The default input stream is stdin (reading lines from a pipe).
The generated sequences vary depending on the input (--transcript) and the type of the query (-t) and the codon type (-c).
If the --transcript option is set, then 
   -t cds -> CDS sequence,
   -t tx -> exons+introns, 
   -t ex -> exons sequence default)
   -c dna -> DNA sequence default,
   -c rna -> RNA sequence [T=U]
   -c aa -> one letter amino acid
Note: the -c option is used only when -t cds is selected (coding sequence)
If the --transcript option is not set then just return the sequence without any further processing

The header line of each sequence starts with the feature accession id if exists 

#################################################
fileConverter (cpp) --> uses ggenome c++ libraries
#################################################
  Converting one genome coordinates file type into another type.
  Some of the arguments 
  1. converter type
     a. --gtf2genePred,  -> convert a gtf file to a gene Prediction file 
     b. --genePred2gtf,
     c. --gff32genePred,
     d. --genePred2gff3,
     e. --gff2genePred,
     f. --genePred2gff,
     g. --sam2fastq
     h. --fastq2sam
     .....
  2. Input file (the from file)
  3. Output file (the To file)

Note: One would ask why the need to write this converter when you can download and run any one of the converter types
from UCSC. The problems are:
 1. I downloaded gtf2genePred from UCSC and noticed that the converted file did not include some of the important fields
    from the original gtf file. For example the gene field was missing in the gene prediction file when present in the original file
 2. currently you need to download a converter specific to every type of conversion.
    In fileConverter, this will be just a function call.
 3. Some of these converters work good with small/average sized (<=1G) but on large files do not seem to work.
    (for example I read that on small SAM files (730MB), samtofastq of Picard tools does a wonderful job.
     But on large SAM files (33G), samtofastq does not seem to work)
