NMF analysis pipeline output files:All output filenames begin with the prefix set by the Ðo option at the command line.  The files generated, in order of steps of the analysis are:1: fa2stats:        prefix.stat : mono- and di-nucleotide counts and frequencies from input file2: WindowCount  (assuming w = 3, k = 4):	prefix.w3k4.s2.counts.txt  The critical file for further analysis: a  tab-delimited text file with the positional word count (PWC) matrix where rows represent each k-mer and columns the counts within each aligned window.  The first row has as headers the position at the start of each window, and the first column is the k-mers (ranked in decreasing s-squared).	Additional files that can be ignored for nmf	prefix.w3k4.s2.txt:  the actual s^2 values (similar to chi-squared) that rank the k-mers for output in the .s2.counts.txt file.	prefix.w3k4.ranks.txt	prefix.w3k4.chi.txt3: nmfSmoothAndPseudoCounts:	prefix.sw3k4.counts.txt: the transformed PWC matrix after smoothing and addition of pseudocounts4: nnmf (assuming r = 8):	prefix..sw3k4r8.weights.txt:  The positioning matrix, giving the probability of observing a given motif at a specific position.	prefix..sw3k4r8.bases.txt:  The sequence content, giving the probability of observing each k-mer as a part of each motif.	prefix..sw3k4r8.prog.txt:  A file that simply tracks the progress of the analysis  (can be deleted after the run is complete).5: nmfSortMatrix:	prefix.sw3k4r8.nweights.txt: Normalized version of the nmf weights, such that all vectors have common integration.	prefix.sw3k4r8.rwords.txt:  A text table that separates each column in the base file, sorting by decreasing contribution of k-mer to the motif.  In the final output there are two columns per motif, k-mer and weight, sorted by decreasing weight.6: nmfWplot:	prefix.sw3k4r8.n.png:  Line plot of positioning for normalized nmf weights	prefix.sw3k4r8.w.png:  Line plot of positioning for raw nmf weights7: buildMotifs:	prefix.sw3k4r8.motifs:  Text listing of the matrixes describing the MCMC-derived motifs from the NMF bases8: nmfMotifsToModels:	prefix.sw3k4r8.models.txt: reformatted file with matrixes for the motifs9: pwmToExamples:	zf.sw3k4r8.A.logoEx.txt:  random sequences for logo for the first motif	zf.sw3k4r8.B.logoEx.txt:  random sequences for logo for the second motif	É10: seqlogo:	zf.sw3k4r8.A.png:  sequence logo image for the first motif	zf.sw3k4r8.B.png:  sequence logo image for the second motif	É11 nmfWeb:	prefix.sw3k4r8.html:  The web page that displays the results.
