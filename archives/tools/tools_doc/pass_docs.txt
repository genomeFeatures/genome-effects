Dear Lucie,

I am sorry for the late answer.

The sensitivity of the program is closely correlated to the structure
of the seed pattern.
By default the seed pattern is set to 1111110111111 and produces
more rows compared to the 11 contiguous bases pattern 11111111111.
Therefore with a seed pattern 111110111111 the result file could be
greater.

Then there is another question ... the length of the query.
The program executes some approximations and sometimes closer values
of fid% are considered as the same set.
For short reads of 20 bases, for example, 1 mismatch decreases about 5%
the %identity of the alignment and only 2% (90 to 92) is not enough.


Sincerely,
Davide
