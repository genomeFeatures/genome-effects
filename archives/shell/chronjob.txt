A better solution would be to create a new user for MySQL with access to SELECT and INSERT (for optimization) and then run the cron job with that user.

eg.

mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO ‘mysql_opt_db’@'localhost’ identified by ‘hard password’;
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> exit;

> crontab -e
# MySQL weekly optimisation
0 0 * * 0 /usr/bin/mysqlcheck -hharlequin -aos -umysql_update_usr -pupdatepass > /dev/null 2>&1

On another point, –-auto-repair should only be used when you have a corrupted database, which obviously should not need to be run on a regular basis (and never once a day!).

0 1 * * * mysqlcheck -Aao –optimize -u root -p[password] > /dev/null

#run this cron job at 5:30am every 2nd of the month
30 16 * * * perl /home/lnh/ensembl_load/getEnsemblAnnotations.pl -o /cgd/data1/cgdsnpdb/ensembl_annotations/ > /home/lnh/ensembl_load/run_logs.log
