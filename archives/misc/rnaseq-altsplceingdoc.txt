We consider:
a. Isoform or transcript:  refer to a distinct RNA molecule transcribed from a gene locus
b. gene: refer to the set of isoforms transcribed from the same genomic region and from the same strand
, sharing some exonic sequence -
Note: Complexity - what if two different genes share the same exonic region?
Do they become isoforms of the same gene? this is where defining gene as uniq aggregate genomic region
could come handy.

c. gene locus: refer to gene genomic region
d. splicing event: refer to the exonic region of a gene that shows variability across two or more of its isoforms
Note: splicing events generally include:
1. exon skipping
2. alternative 5' and 3' splice-sites
3. mutually exclusive exons
5. retained introns
6. alternative first exons and alternative last exons
7. or a combination of two or more of the above
